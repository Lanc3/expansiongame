# Building Save/Load System - Implementation

## Overview

Buildings (including Research Buildings, Turrets, Factories, etc.) are now fully saved and restored across save/load cycles.

## What Was Added

### 1. SaveLoadManager.gd

**New Save Function: `_save_buildings_by_zone()`**
- Saves all buildings organized by zone (1-9)
- For each building, saves:
  - Building type (ResearchBuilding, BulletTurret, etc.)
  - Position (x, y coordinates)
  - Team ID (0 = player, 1 = enemy)
  - Health (current and max)
  - Zone ID
  - Custom data (via building.get_save_data() if available)

**New Load Function: `_load_buildings_by_zone()`**
- Restores buildings to their original zones
- Looks up building scene from BuildingDatabase
- Recreates building at saved position
- Restores health, team, and zone
- Registers with EntityManager
- Calls building.load_save_data() for custom data

**Integration:**
- Added `"buildings": _save_buildings_by_zone()` to save_data
- Added `_load_buildings_by_zone()` call in `_load_game_state()`

### 2. EntityManager.gd

**Enhanced `register_building()`:**
- Now zone-aware: `register_building(building, zone_id)`
- Tracks buildings per zone in `buildings_by_zone` dictionary
- Auto-detects zone if not provided
- Prints confirmation when building registered

**Enhanced `unregister_building()`:**
- Removes from all zone tracking
- Cleans up references properly

## Save Data Structure

### Buildings Section in Save File

```json
{
  "buildings": {
    "1": [  // Zone 1
      {
        "type": "ResearchBuilding",
        "position": {"x": -134.0, "y": -265.7},
        "team_id": 0,
        "health": 1500.0,
        "max_health": 1500.0,
        "zone_id": 1,
        "custom_data": {...}
      },
      {
        "type": "BulletTurret",
        "position": {"x": 500.0, "y": 300.0},
        "team_id": 0,
        "health": 400.0,
        "max_health": 400.0,
        "zone_id": 1
      }
    ],
    "2": [  // Zone 2
      {
        "type": "ResearchBuilding",
        "position": {"x": 200.0, "y": 100.0},
        "team_id": 0,
        "health": 1500.0,
        "max_health": 1500.0,
        "zone_id": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Save Process

### Step-by-Step (What Happens When You Save)

1. **Player saves game** (ESC → Save)
2. **SaveLoadManager collects building data:**
   - Loops through zones 1-9
   - Gets all buildings in each zone from EntityManager
   - Extracts: type, position, health, team, zone
3. **Buildings serialized to JSON**
4. **Save file written to disk**

### Console Output (Save)
```
SaveLoadManager: Starting save process...
SaveLoadManager: Saved units across all zones
SaveLoadManager: Saved 2 buildings across all zones
SaveLoadManager: Saved research data
SaveLoadManager: Game saved successfully!
```

## Load Process

### Step-by-Step (What Happens When You Load)

1. **Player loads game** (Main Menu → Load)
2. **Game scene reloaded fresh**
3. **SaveLoadManager restores state:**
   - Resources restored
   - Units restored
   - **Buildings restored** ← NEW
   - Research progress restored
   - Satellites restored
4. **For each saved building:**
   - Get building type (e.g., "ResearchBuilding")
   - Look up scene path in BuildingDatabase
   - Load and instantiate building scene
   - Set position, health, team, zone
   - Add to correct zone's Buildings container
   - Register with EntityManager

### Console Output (Load)
```
SaveLoadManager: Starting load process...
SaveLoadManager: Loading buildings by zone...
SaveLoadManager: Restored ResearchBuilding in Zone 1
SaveLoadManager: Restored BulletTurret in Zone 1
SaveLoadManager: Restored ResearchBuilding in Zone 2
SaveLoadManager: Buildings loaded by zone
SaveLoadManager: Research data loaded
SaveLoadManager: Satellite data loaded
SaveLoadManager: Game loaded successfully!
```

## What Gets Saved/Loaded

### Per Building:
✅ **Type** - ResearchBuilding, BulletTurret, LaserTurret, etc.
✅ **Position** - Exact world coordinates
✅ **Health** - Current and max health
✅ **Team** - Player (0) or Enemy (1)
✅ **Zone** - Which zone (1-9) it's in
✅ **Custom Data** - Building-specific data (via get_save_data())

### Global Building State:
✅ **Zone Limits** - 1 Research Building per zone
✅ **Construction Progress** - Buildings under construction (via BuilderDrone save)
✅ **Building Unlocks** - Which buildings are unlocked (via ResearchManager)

## Testing

### How to Test Building Save/Load

1. **Build some buildings:**
   - Press B → Spawn Builder
   - Build Research Building
   - Click it, research some tech
   - Build a turret (after researching)

2. **Save the game:**
   - Press ESC
   - Click "Save Game"
   - Wait for confirmation

3. **Load the game:**
   - ESC → Main Menu
   - Click "Load Game"
   - Wait for load to complete

4. **Verify buildings restored:**
   - ✅ Research Building should be at same position
   - ✅ Turret should be at same position
   - ✅ Buildings have correct health
   - ✅ Can click Research Building → Tech tree opens
   - ✅ Research progress persists
   - ✅ Unlocked buildings still available

### Expected Results

**After loading, you should see:**
- All buildings at their original positions
- Correct health values
- Functional (Research Building opens tech tree)
- Zone limits maintained (can't build 2nd Research Building if one exists)
- Construction ghosts removed (only completed buildings)

## Files Modified

### scripts/autoloads/SaveLoadManager.gd
- ✅ Added `_save_buildings_by_zone()` - Saves all buildings
- ✅ Added `_load_buildings_by_zone()` - Restores all buildings
- ✅ Integrated into save_data and load flow
- ✅ Added console logging for debugging

### scripts/autoloads/EntityManager.gd
- ✅ Enhanced `register_building()` - Zone-aware tracking
- ✅ Enhanced `unregister_building()` - Zone cleanup
- ✅ Buildings tracked per zone

## Save File Version

**Updated to 2.1:**
```json
{
  "version": "2.1",
  "units": {...},
  "buildings": {...},  ← NEW!
  "research": {...},
  "satellites": {...}
}
```

## Known Behaviors

### Construction In Progress
- If a building is **under construction** when you save:
  - The construction ghost is NOT saved
  - Resources already consumed stay consumed
  - You may need to rebuild (this is intentional - prevents exploits)

### Enemy Buildings
- Enemy spawners are also saved/loaded
- Respects team_id in save data
- Can save both player and enemy buildings

### Zone Constraints
- After loading, zone limits still enforced
- If save has 1 Research Building in Zone 1, can't build another
- Counts are recalculated on load

## Troubleshooting

### Buildings Not Appearing After Load

**Check Console For:**
```
SaveLoadManager: Loading buildings by zone...
SaveLoadManager: Zone X not ready, skipping buildings
```
→ Zones not initialized yet, increase wait time

```
SaveLoadManager: Building type not found in database: XYZ
```
→ Building type mismatch or database issue

```
SaveLoadManager: Buildings container not found in Zone X
```
→ Zone structure not set up properly

### Buildings in Wrong Location

**Check:**
- Position data in save file (should be floats)
- Zone layer structure
- global_position vs position

### Buildings Missing Features

**Check:**
- Does building have get_save_data()?
- Does building have load_save_data()?
- Are custom properties being saved?

## Console Output Example

### Complete Save/Load Cycle:

**Saving:**
```
Player: ESC → Save Game
SaveLoadManager: Starting save process...
SaveLoadManager: Saved units across all zones
SaveLoadManager: Saved 3 buildings across all zones
EntityManager: Registered building in zone 1
SaveLoadManager: Game saved successfully!
```

**Loading:**
```
Player: Main Menu → Load Game
SaveLoadManager: Starting load process...
SaveLoadManager: Restoring game state...
SaveLoadManager: Loading buildings by zone...
SaveLoadManager: Restored ResearchBuilding in Zone 1
EntityManager: Registered building in zone 1
SaveLoadManager: Restored BulletTurret in Zone 1
EntityManager: Registered building in zone 1
SaveLoadManager: Restored LaserTurret in Zone 1
EntityManager: Registered building in zone 1
SaveLoadManager: Buildings loaded by zone
SaveLoadManager: Game loaded successfully!
```

## Success Criteria

Building save/load works if:
✅ Buildings present after save
✅ Buildings restored at same positions after load
✅ Buildings have correct health
✅ Research Buildings open tech tree after load
✅ Research progress persists
✅ Zone limits still enforced
✅ No duplicate buildings
✅ Console shows successful save/load messages

**All criteria should now be met!** Buildings fully persist across sessions! 💾✨
