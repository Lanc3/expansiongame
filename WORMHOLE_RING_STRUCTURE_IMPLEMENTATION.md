# Wormhole Ring Structure Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully refactored the wormhole generation system to create a proper concentric ring galaxy structure with deterministic zone positioning and controlled wormhole connections.

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING

---

## What Was Changed

### Phase 1: Zone Position Architecture ✅
**File**: `scripts/autoloads/ZoneManager.gd`

**Changes**:
1. Added `zone_index` to zone data structure - deterministic position on ring (0 to N-1)
2. Added `get_zone_angle(difficulty, zone_index)` - calculates fixed angle for zone on ring
3. Added `get_depth_portal_zone_index(difficulty)` - determines which zone gets purple wormholes
4. Added `should_zone_have_depth_portal(zone_id)` - checks if zone is designated portal
5. Added `get_zones_at_difficulty_sorted()` - returns zones sorted by index
6. Added `get_zone_neighbors(zone_id)` - returns left/right neighbor zone IDs
7. Updated `create_zone_data()` - now takes zone_index instead of ring_position
8. Updated `generate_lateral_zone()` - validates max zones per ring
9. Updated `get_zone_wormhole_spawn_position()` - removed random angle, requires explicit angle

**Result**: Zones now have deterministic positions evenly distributed on their rings.

---

### Phase 2: Blue Wormhole Generation (Lateral/Ring Connections) ✅
**File**: `scripts/systems/ZoneSetup.gd`

**Changes**:
1. Rewrote `create_wormholes_for_zone()` - creates exactly 2 lateral wormholes per zone
2. Added `create_lateral_wormholes()` - creates left and right neighbor connections
3. Added `create_lateral_wormhole_to_neighbor()` - creates wormhole to known neighbor
4. Added `create_undiscovered_lateral_wormhole()` - creates wormhole to undiscovered neighbor slot
5. Added `calculate_angle_to_neighbor()` - calculates direction angle toward neighbor
6. Added `calculate_angle_between_ring_positions()` - normalizes angles for shortest path

**Result**: Each zone has exactly 2 blue wormholes connecting to left and right neighbors on the same ring, forming a complete circle.

---

### Phase 3: Purple Wormhole Generation (Depth Connections) ✅
**File**: `scripts/systems/ZoneSetup.gd`

**Changes**:
1. Updated `create_wormholes_for_zone()` - only creates depth wormholes if zone is portal zone
2. Updated `create_depth_wormhole()` - finds portal zone at target difficulty
3. Depth wormholes now bidirectional (forward and backward) only on designated portal zones

**Result**: Only 1 zone per ring has purple wormholes (both forward and backward), connecting to adjacent ring's portal zone.

---

### Phase 4: Galaxy Map Visualization ✅
**File**: `scripts/ui/GalaxyMapUI.gd`

**Changes**:
1. Updated `calculate_galaxy_position()` - replaced spiral formula with concentric rings
2. Zones now display at fixed angles based on their ring_position
3. Radius calculated as evenly spaced rings from outer (difficulty 1) to center (difficulty 9)

**Result**: Galaxy map displays proper concentric rings with zones evenly distributed.

---

### Phase 5: Minimap Wormhole Display ✅
**File**: `scripts/ui/Minimap.gd`

**Changes**:
1. Updated wormhole coloring to distinguish lateral (blue/cyan) vs depth (purple)
2. Verified minimap correctly displays wormholes at their deterministic positions

**Result**: Minimap shows blue wormholes for lateral connections, purple for depth connections.

---

### Phase 6: On-Demand Zone Generation ✅
**File**: `scripts/autoloads/ZoneDiscoveryManager.gd`

**Changes**:
1. Updated `generate_and_discover_depth_zone()` - finds or creates portal zone at target difficulty
2. Updated `create_return_lateral_wormhole()` - now relies on ring structure (mostly redundant)
3. Updated `create_return_depth_wormhole()` - ensures bidirectional portal connections

**Result**: Dynamically generated zones follow ring structure rules.

## Architecture Summary

### Ring Structure
- **9 Rings (Depths)**: Difficulty 1 (outer) to 9 (center)
- **Zones Per Ring**: 8, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2 (total 40 zones)
- **Zone Positioning**: Evenly distributed angles on each ring
  - Ring with 8 zones: zones at 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°
  - Ring with 4 zones: zones at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°
  - etc.

### Wormhole System

#### Blue Wormholes (Lateral)
- **Purpose**: Connect zones on the same ring (same difficulty)
- **Count**: 2 per zone (left and right neighbors)
- **Color**: Cyan/teal (Color(0.3, 0.8, 0.8))
- **Connection**: Forms complete ring - leftmost connects to rightmost
- **Position**: Angled toward neighbor zone on ring

#### Purple Wormholes (Depth)
- **Purpose**: Connect between adjacent rings (different difficulty)
- **Count**: Only on designated portal zone per ring
  - 1 portal zone per ring (deterministically selected by seed)
  - Portal zone has 2 depth wormholes: forward (inward) and backward (outward)
- **Color**: 
  - Forward (toward center): Purple (Color(0.7, 0.4, 1.0))
  - Backward (toward outer): Blue-purple (Color(0.3, 0.6, 1.0))
- **Connection**: Bidirectional between portal zones on adjacent rings
- **Position**: Forward at 0° (right), backward at 180° (left)

### Zone Data Structure
```gdscript
{
    "zone_id": String,           # e.g., "d1_start", "d1_zone_1"
    "difficulty": int,           # 1-9
    "zone_index": int,           # 0 to (zones_per_ring - 1)
    "procedural_name": String,   # e.g., "Outer Sector Alpha"
    "discovered": bool,
    "ring_position": float,      # Angle in radians (0 to TAU)
    "size_multiplier": float,
    "spawn_area_size": float,
    "boundaries": Rect2,
    "layer_node": Node2D,
    "lateral_wormholes": Array,  # Blue wormholes
    "depth_wormholes": Array,    # Purple wormholes
    "max_resource_tier": int
}
```

## Testing Guide

### Visual Testing

1. **Start New Game**
   - Initial zone should have 2 blue wormholes (left/right neighbors)
   - Check if exactly 1 zone has purple wormholes (forward/backward)
   - Purple zone should be deterministic (same each time with same seed)

2. **Test Blue Wormhole Travel**
   - Travel through left blue wormhole → should arrive at left neighbor
   - Travel through right blue wormhole → should arrive at right neighbor
   - Travel around entire ring → should form complete circle back to start

3. **Test Purple Wormhole Travel**
   - Find portal zone with purple wormholes
   - Travel through forward purple wormhole → should go to inner ring portal zone
   - Check inner ring portal zone has purple wormhole back → travel back
   - Should arrive at original portal zone

4. **Galaxy Map Visualization (Press M)**
   - Zones should display in concentric rings
   - Outer ring (difficulty 1) should have 8 zones evenly spaced
   - Each ring should have correct number of zones
   - Connection lines:
     - Blue/cyan lines connect zones on same ring
     - Purple lines connect portal zones between rings

5. **Minimap Display**
   - Wormholes should appear at edges of visible zone
   - Blue wormholes point left/right to neighbors
   - Purple wormholes (if in portal zone) point right (forward) and left (backward)

### Functional Testing

1. **Zone Discovery**
   ```
   Start → Travel right (blue) → Discover neighbor → Travel right again → ...
   → Should discover entire ring
   → Ring should close (8th neighbor connects back to 1st)
   ```

2. **Depth Progression**
   ```
   Find portal zone → Travel forward (purple) → Arrive at inner ring portal
   → Inner ring has new difficulty resources
   → Travel backward (purple) → Return to outer ring portal
   ```

3. **Ring Limits**
   ```
   Discover all zones on a ring (e.g., 8 zones on ring 1)
   → Blue wormholes should no longer generate undiscovered zones
   → All zones connected in complete circle
   ```

4. **Portal Zone Consistency**
   ```
   Restart game with same seed → portal zone should be same
   Restart with different seed → portal zone might be different
   ```

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty Rings**
   - Start game → only 1 zone exists
   - Travel creates neighbors on-demand
   - Eventually fill entire ring

2. **Multi-Ring Discovery**
   - Travel to inner ring via purple wormhole
   - Explore inner ring with blue wormholes
   - Inner ring should also have proper structure

3. **Bidirectional Connections**
   - Every wormhole should have a return wormhole
   - No one-way connections
   - Test by traveling A→B→A (should work both ways)

## Debug Commands (Recommended)

To help with testing, consider adding these debug functions:

```gdscript
# In ZoneManager.gd
func debug_print_zone_structure():
    """Print complete zone network structure"""
    for difficulty in range(1, 10):
        var zones = get_zones_at_difficulty_sorted(difficulty)
        print("Ring %d (%d zones):" % [difficulty, zones.size()])
        for zone in zones:
            var is_portal = should_zone_have_depth_portal(zone.zone_id)
            var portal_str = " [PORTAL]" if is_portal else ""
            print("  %s (index %d, angle %.1f°)%s" % [
                zone.zone_id, zone.zone_index, 
                rad_to_deg(zone.ring_position), portal_str
            ])

func debug_print_wormhole_network():
    """Print all wormhole connections"""
    for zone_id in zones_by_id:
        var zone = zones_by_id[zone_id]
        print("\n%s:" % zone_id)
        print("  Blue wormholes: %d" % zone.lateral_wormholes.size())
        for wh in zone.lateral_wormholes:
            if is_instance_valid(wh):
                print("    → %s (%.1f°)" % [wh.target_zone_id, rad_to_deg(wh.wormhole_direction)])
        print("  Purple wormholes: %d" % zone.depth_wormholes.size())
        for wh in zone.depth_wormholes:
            if is_instance_valid(wh):
                var direction = "forward" if wh.get_meta("is_forward", true) else "backward"
                print("    → %s (%s)" % [wh.target_zone_id, direction])
```
