# Multi-Zone System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a 9-zone universe system where each zone increases in size and rarity, connected by bi-directional wormholes. Progress in each zone persists independently.

## Architecture

### Zone System
- **9 Progressive Zones**: Zone 1 (1x size) through Zone 9 (9x size)
- **Base Zone Size**: 4000x4000 units (Zone 1), scales by multiplier
- **Resource Tiers**: Cumulative system
  - Zone 1: Tier 0 only
  - Zone 2: Tiers 0-1
  - Zone 3: Tiers 0-2
  - ...
  - Zone 9: Tiers 0-8

### Key Components Created

#### 1. ZoneManager (Autoload)
**File**: `scripts/autoloads/ZoneManager.gd`
- Manages all 9 zones and their data structures
- Tracks current_zone_id (which zone camera is viewing)
- Handles zone switching and unit transfers
- Provides zone boundaries and metadata

**Key Methods**:
- `get_zone(id)` - Get zone data
- `switch_to_zone(id)` - Switch camera view to different zone
- `transfer_units_to_zone(units, target_zone_id, spawn_position)` - Move units between zones
- `get_unit_zone(unit)` - Determine which zone a unit is in

#### 2. Wormhole System
**Files**: `scenes/world/Wormhole.tscn`, `scripts/world/Wormhole.gd`
- Bi-directional portals connecting adjacent zones
- Visual effects: swirling particles, glow effects
- Clickable/selectable interface
- Random placement at zone edges

**Features**:
- `travel_units(units)` - Transfer selected units to target zone
- Spawns units at random offset near destination wormhole
- Travel and arrival visual effects

#### 3. Zone-Based Resource Spawning
**Modified**: `scripts/systems/ResourceSpawner.gd`
- Spawns 50 asteroids per zone (configurable)
- Resources filtered by zone tier limits
- Each zone has independent resource distribution

**Modified**: `scripts/data/ResourceDatabase.gd`
- New method: `get_weighted_random_resource_for_zone(zone_id)`
- Filters available tiers based on zone
- Maintains weighted distribution within allowed tiers

#### 4. Zone Structure Setup
**File**: `scripts/systems/ZoneSetup.gd`
- Programmatically creates 9 zone layers on game start
- Each zone contains:
  - Entities/Units container
  - Entities/Resources container
  - Entities/Buildings container
  - Wormholes container
  - ZoneBoundary system
- Creates wormholes for zones 1-8

#### 5. Hard Boundaries
**File**: `scripts/systems/ZoneBoundary.gd`
- Prevents units from crossing zone boundaries
- Clamps unit positions to zone limits
- 50-unit boundary thickness for safety

#### 6. Updated Systems

**RTSCamera** (`scripts/systems/RTSCamera.gd`):
- Respects zone-specific boundaries
- Updates bounds when switching zones
- `set_zone_bounds(bounds)` method

**EntityManager** (`scripts/autoloads/EntityManager.gd`):
- Zone-aware entity tracking
- `units_by_zone`, `resources_by_zone` dictionaries
- Methods: `get_units_in_zone(zone_id)`, `update_unit_zone(unit, old_zone_id, new_zone_id)`

**CommandSystem** (`scripts/autoloads/CommandSystem.gd`):
- New command type: `TRAVEL_WORMHOLE`
- Detects wormhole clicks
- `issue_wormhole_travel_command(units, wormhole)` method

**Minimap** (`scripts/ui/Minimap.gd`):
- Shows only current zone entities
- Updates world_size based on current zone
- Responds to zone switches

#### 7. Zone Switcher UI
**Files**: `scenes/ui/ZoneSwitcher.tscn`, `scripts/ui/ZoneSwitcher.gd`
- Manual zone navigation buttons (< >)
- Current zone display
- Visual indicators showing which zones contain player units
- Integrated into GameScene UI (top-center)

#### 8. Save/Load System
**Modified**: `scripts/autoloads/SaveLoadManager.gd`
- Save version 2.0 (multi-zone support)
- Saves units and resources organized by zone
- Saves wormhole positions
- Saves current_zone_id
- Restores entities to correct zones on load
- Backward compatible with legacy format

## Game Flow

### Initial Spawn
1. Player starts in Zone 1 with command ship and starting units
2. All 9 zones generated with resources appropriate to their tier
3. Wormholes placed randomly at zone edges
4. Only Zone 1 visible initially

### Zone Travel
1. Select units
2. Right-click on wormhole
3. Units instantly transfer to target zone at random position near destination wormhole
4. Camera remains in current zone (player manually switches view)

### Zone Switching
1. Use Zone Switcher UI (< > buttons)
2. Or call `ZoneManager.switch_to_zone(id)` programmatically
3. Camera bounds update automatically
4. Minimap updates to show new zone

### Background Activity
- All zones remain active (units continue operating in background)
- Mining, movement, combat continues in non-viewed zones
- Full persistence across zone switches

## Technical Details

### Zone Boundaries
- Each zone has a Rect2 boundary
- Hard boundaries prevent unauthorized crossing
- Boundary system runs in _process(), checking unit positions every frame

### Wormhole Mechanics
- Zone 1 wormhole connects to Zone 2
- Zone 2 wormhole connects to Zone 3
- ...
- Zone 8 wormhole connects to Zone 9
- Zone 9 has no forward wormhole (deepest zone)
- All wormholes are bi-directional

### Resource Distribution
Uses existing weighted tier system but filters by max zone tier:
- Common resources (Tier 0-2) appear in early zones
- Uncommon resources (Tier 3-5) appear in mid zones  
- Rare resources (Tier 6-7) appear in deep zones
- Ultra-rare resources (Tier 8-9) only in deepest zones

## Testing Checklist

- [x] All 9 zones generate at game start with correct sizes
- [x] Resources spawn with correct rarity tiers per zone
- [x] Wormholes positioned at zone edges and selectable
- [x] Selected units can travel through wormholes
- [x] Camera stays in current zone when units travel
- [x] Zone states persist when switching views
- [x] Hard boundaries prevent unauthorized zone crossing
- [x] CommandShip can travel through wormholes
- [x] Zone switcher UI shows current zone
- [x] Minimap shows only current zone
- [x] Save/Load preserves all zone states
