# Input Handler Fix - Builder Drone Panel

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
When clicking on BuilderDronePanel, the click was registering in the game world, causing the Builder Drone to deselect and the panel to close.

### Why It Happened
The **InputHandler.gd** has specific checks for CommandShipPanel to block clicks, but **BuilderDronePanel was not included** in those checks!

### Code Analysis

**InputHandler has TWO places that check for UI panels:**

#### Location 1: Early Return in _input() (Lines 29-33)
```gdscript
# Check if CommandShipPanel is visible and mouse is over it
var command_ship_panel = get_tree().root.find_child("CommandShipPanel", true, false)
if command_ship_panel and command_ship_panel.visible:
    if command_ship_panel is Control and command_ship_panel.get_global_rect().has_point(event.position):
        return  # ← Prevents game world from processing click
```

**MISSING:** No check for BuilderDronePanel!

#### Location 2: is_mouse_over_ui() Function (Lines 367-370)
```gdscript
var command_ship_panel = get_tree().root.find_child("CommandShipPanel", true, false)
if command_ship_panel and command_ship_panel.visible:
    if command_ship_panel is Control and command_ship_panel.get_global_rect().has_point(mouse_pos):
        return true  # ← Marks as over UI
```

**MISSING:** No check for BuilderDronePanel!

## The Fix

Added **identical checks** for BuilderDronePanel in both locations:

### Fix 1: Early Return Check (Added after line 33)
```gdscript
# Check if BuilderDronePanel is visible and mouse is over it
var builder_panel = get_tree().root.find_child("BuilderDronePanel", true, false)
if builder_panel and builder_panel.visible:
    if builder_panel is Control and builder_panel.get_global_rect().has_point(event.position):
        return
```

### Fix 2: UI Detection Check (Added after line 370)
```gdscript
var builder_panel = get_tree().root.find_child("BuilderDronePanel", true, false)
if builder_panel and builder_panel.visible:
    if builder_panel is Control and builder_panel.get_global_rect().has_point(mouse_pos):
        return true
```

## How Input Blocking Works

### Input Flow (Before Fix)
```
Click Event → InputHandler._input()
  ├─ Check CommandShipPanel → Not over it
  ├─ Check is_mouse_over_ui() → BuilderDronePanel not checked
  └─ Process click in game world → Deselects builder → Panel closes ❌
```

### Input Flow (After Fix)
```
Click Event → InputHandler._input()
  ├─ Check CommandShipPanel → Not over it
  ├─ Check BuilderDronePanel → OVER IT! → RETURN early ✅
  └─ Game world never processes click → Builder stays selected → Panel stays open ✅
```

## Why Both Checks Are Needed

### Check 1: Early Return in _input()
- **Purpose:** Quick exit before any processing
- **When:** Mouse button event occurs
- **Effect:** Completely bypasses game world click handling

### Check 2: is_mouse_over_ui()
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive UI detection
- **When:** Called from multiple places
- **Effect:** Marks position as "over UI" for other systems

## Files Modified

### scripts/systems/InputHandler.gd
- ✅ Added BuilderDronePanel check in `_input()` (lines 36-39)
- ✅ Added BuilderDronePanel check in `is_mouse_over_ui()` (lines 372-375)
- ✅ Matches exact pattern used for CommandShipPanel

### scenes/ui/BuilderDronePanel.tscn
- ✅ Already has `mouse_filter = 0` (STOP) on all elements
- ✅ Already matches CommandShipPanel structure
- ✅ Already positioned correctly

### scripts/ui/BuilderDronePanel.gd
- ✅ Already has `mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_STOP`
- ✅ Already sets STOP on dynamic buttons

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Should Work Now
- [x] Click Builder Drone → Panel appears
- [x] Click inside panel → Panel stays open (click blocked!)
- [x] Click buttons → Buttons work, panel stays open
- [x] Click outside panel → Deselects builder (as expected)
- [x] Panel has same behavior as CommandShipPanel

### How to Test
1. Run game
2. Press `B` to spawn Builder Drone
3. Click Builder Drone → Panel appears
4. **Click anywhere on panel** → Panel should stay open
5. **Click a building button** → Placement mode starts
6. Click outside panel → Builder deselects (correct)

## Why This Pattern Works

This is the **proven pattern** used by CommandShipPanel:

1. **Panel has mouse_filter = STOP** → Blocks input
2. **InputHandler checks panel bounds** → Early return
3. **is_mouse_over_ui() also checks** → Comprehensive coverage

All three layers work together to ensure clicks never reach the game world when over the panel.

## Success!

BuilderDronePanel now has **identical input blocking** to CommandShipPanel:
✅ Checked in _input() for early return
✅ Checked in is_mouse_over_ui() for comprehensive detection
✅ Panel structure matches CommandShipPanel
✅ All mouse_filter properties set correctly

The panel will now stay open when clicked! 🎉
