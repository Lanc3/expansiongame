# Construction Flow Fix - Preventing Duplicate Triggers

## Problem
Construction was starting then immediately cancelling. Console showed:
```
BuilderDrone: Starting construction of ResearchBuilding
PlacementController: Building placed at (-280.0, -185.3333)
PlacementController: Placement cancelled
[Repeats multiple times]
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Multiple Placement Triggers
- Button click starts placement mode
- Same button might be clicked again before first placement completes
- PlacementController was allowing multiple simultaneous placements

### 2. Multiple Construction Calls
- BuilderDrone.start_construction() being called multiple times
- No guard against duplicate construction requests
- Each call creates a new ghost, destroying the previous one

### 3. No State Tracking
- BuilderDronePanel didn't track if placement was active
- PlacementController didn't block duplicate starts
- No feedback loop between panel and controller

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: BuilderDrone - Guard Against Duplicates

**Added to start_construction():**
```gdscript
# Check if already constructing
if build_state != BuildState.IDLE:
    print("BuilderDrone: Already constructing, ignoring new construction request")
    return
```

**Effect:** Prevents builder from starting construction while already busy

### Fix 2: PlacementController - Prevent Simultaneous Placement

**Added to start_placement():**
```gdscript
if is_placing:
    print("PlacementController: Already in placement mode, ignoring new request")
    return
```

**Effect:** Only one placement mode at a time

### Fix 3: BuilderDronePanel - Track Placement State

**Added:**
```gdscript
var is_placement_active: bool = false

func _on_building_button_pressed(building_type: String):
    if is_placement_active:
        print("BuilderDronePanel: Placement already active, ignoring button press")
        return
    
    is_placement_active = true
    start_building_placement(building_type)
```

**Effect:** Button can't be clicked again until placement finishes

### Fix 4: Signal Communication

**Added signals to PlacementController:**
```gdscript
signal placement_completed()
signal placement_cancelled()
```

**BuilderDronePanel connects and resets:**
```gdscript
func _on_placement_completed():
    is_placement_active = false
    update_status("Construction in progress...")

func _on_placement_cancelled_signal():
    is_placement_active = false
    update_status("Select a building to construct")
```

**Effect:** Panel knows when placement is done and resets properly

### Fix 5: Enhanced Debug Output

**BuilderDrone now prints:**
- Starting construction with distance
- When ghost is destroyed (with reason)
- When arriving at site
- Progress every 10% (10%, 20%, 30%...)

**PlacementController now prints:**
- When already in placement mode (duplicate blocked)
- When placement confirmed with position
- When placement cancelled

**Effect:** Easy to diagnose issues in console

### Fix 6: Improved Progress Visuals

**ConstructionGhost improvements:**
- **Larger progress bar:** 120√ó16 (was 100√ó10)
- **Shows percentage:** "67%"
- **Styled:** Green fill, dark background, border
- **"CONSTRUCTING..." label:** Yellow text above bar
- **Blue tint:** Ghost turns blue during construction
- **Opacity transition:** Ghost becomes more solid (0.3 ‚Üí 1.0)

## New Construction Flow

### Step-by-Step (What Should Happen)

1. **Click building button** ‚Üí `is_placement_active = true`
2. **PlacementController.start_placement()** ‚Üí Creates placement ghost (follows mouse)
3. **Left click to place** ‚Üí PlacementController validates
4. **Builder.start_construction()** ‚Üí Creates construction ghost at position
5. **placement_completed signal** ‚Üí Panel resets `is_placement_active = false`
6. **PlacementController.cancel_placement()** ‚Üí Removes placement ghost
7. **Builder moves to site** ‚Üí Changes to MOVING_TO_SITE state
8. **Builder arrives** ‚Üí Changes to CONSTRUCTING state
9. **construction_ghost.start_construction()** ‚Üí Shows progress bar
10. **Progress updates** ‚Üí Every frame, 0% ‚Üí 100%
11. **Construction complete** ‚Üí Real building spawns
12. **Ghost removed** ‚Üí Builder back to IDLE

## Console Output (Expected)

```
BuilderDronePanel: Building selected: ResearchBuilding
PlacementController: Placement mode started for ResearchBuilding (ghost created)
[Move mouse around...]
PlacementController: Building placed at (500, 500), starting construction
BuilderDrone: Starting construction of ResearchBuilding at (500, 500) (distance: 150.0)
PlacementController: Placement cancelled
BuilderDronePanel: Placement completed, resetting state
ConstructionGhost: Construction started at (500, 500)
BuilderDrone: Arrived at site, beginning construction of ResearchBuilding
BuilderDrone: Ghost notified, progress bar should be visible
BuilderDrone: Construction 10% complete
BuilderDrone: Construction 20% complete
...
BuilderDrone: Construction 100% complete
BuilderDrone: Construction of ResearchBuilding complete
ConstructionGhost: Construction complete, spawning building
ConstructionGhost: Spawned ResearchBuilding at (500, 500)
```

## What's Different Now

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Button can be spam-clicked | ‚úÖ Blocked until placement done |
| Multiple placements at once | ‚úÖ Only one at a time |
| Construction called multiple times | ‚úÖ Guards against duplicates |
| No visual feedback during build | ‚úÖ Progress bar + label |
| Small hard-to-see progress | ‚úÖ Large bar with percentage |
| No state communication | ‚úÖ Signals between systems |
| Hard to debug | ‚úÖ Extensive console output |

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Should Work Now
- [ ] Click button once ‚Üí Placement starts
- [ ] Click button again ‚Üí Ignored (already placing)
- [ ] Place building ‚Üí Only ONE construction starts
- [ ] Progress bar appears with "CONSTRUCTING..."
- [ ] Progress increases 0% ‚Üí 100%
- [ ] Real building spawns at 100%
- [ ] Can build another building after first completes

### ‚úÖ Console Should Show
- [ ] "Placement mode started"
- [ ] "Building placed at X"
- [ ] "Placement cancelled" (once)
- [ ] "Starting construction"
- [ ] "Construction 10% complete" (every 10%)
- [ ] "Construction complete"
- [ ] "Spawned ResearchBuilding"

### ‚ùå Should NOT Happen
- ~~Multiple "Starting construction" in quick succession~~
- ~~"Already in placement mode" spam~~
- ~~Construction cancelling mid-build~~
- ~~Progress bar not visible~~

## Success Criteria

Construction is working if:
1. ‚úÖ Click button ‚Üí One placement ghost appears
2. ‚úÖ Click to place ‚Üí One construction ghost appears
3. ‚úÖ Progress bar visible with percentage
4. ‚úÖ Progress increases smoothly
5. ‚úÖ Building spawns at 100%
6. ‚úÖ No duplicate or cancelled constructions

All guards and signals are now in place to ensure smooth construction! üèóÔ∏è
