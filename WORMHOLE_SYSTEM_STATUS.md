# Wormhole Ring System - WORKING!

## ✅ System is Functioning Correctly

Based on your logs, the depth travel system IS working:

### Evidence:
1. **Depth wormhole created correctly**:
   ```
   Wormhole_debug :     wormhole_type = 0 (0=DEPTH, 1=LATERAL) ✓
   Wormhole_debug :     source_zone_id = d1_zone_3 ✓
   Wormhole_debug :     target_zone_id = EMPTY (undiscovered) ✓
   ```

2. **d2 zone exists and is displayed**:
   ```
   GalaxyMapUI: Creating zone marker for d2_zone_5
   GalaxyMapUI: Position calc - difficulty=2, radius=240.0 ✓
   ```

3. **Inner ring is closer to center**:
   - Difficulty 1: radius=270 (outer ring)
   - Difficulty 2: radius=240 (inner ring, 30px closer)

## Why It Looks Wrong

### 1. Only ONE d2 Zone Exists
You've only discovered **d2_zone_5** so far. To see a "ring", you need to discover more zones at difficulty 2.

**How to do this:**
- Find other d1 zones that are portal zones
- Travel through their purple wormholes
- Each one leads to a DIFFERENT zone on the d2 ring

OR:
- In d2_zone_5, travel through the **blue lateral wormholes**
- This will discover more zones on the d2 ring (d2_zone_4, d2_zone_6, etc.)

### 2. Rings Are Close Together
Only 30px difference (270 vs 240) makes it hard to see the rings are separate.

**I just increased ring spacing:**
- Changed base_radius from 0.75 to 0.85
- New spacing: ~34px between rings
- More visually distinct

### 3. On-Demand Generation
Zones are **NOT pre-generated**. They are created as you explore:
- Only portal zones exist initially when you travel through depth wormholes
- You must travel laterally to discover more zones on each ring

## What to Do Now

1. **Restart the game** (to apply duplicate wormhole fix + spacing increase)
2. **Travel through purple wormhole** to d2
3. **In d2, travel through BLUE wormholes** to discover more d2 zones
4. **Open galaxy map** - you'll see multiple zones forming an inner ring

## Expected Behavior

After discovering 3-4 zones on the d2 ring, you'll see:
```
GALAXY MAP:
    
    d1_start●―●d1_zone_1    ← Outer ring (radius ~306)
   ●          ●            ●
  d1_7      d2_5          d1_2  ← Inner ring visible (radius ~272)
   ●          ●            ●
    d1_6  ●―●d1_3  ●―●d1_4
```

The system is **working perfectly** - you just need to explore more to see the full ring structure!
