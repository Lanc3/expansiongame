# Mining Visual Clarity Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented visual mining lasers and floating cargo capacity indicators for mining drones, providing clear, real-time feedback during mining operations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Mining Laser Beam System
**Location:** `scripts/units/MiningDrone.gd`

**Implementation:**
- Line2D rendering system with animated laser texture
- Green laser beam (`laserGreen07.png`) connects drone to asteroid
- Only visible during active mining
- Pulse animation effect (width and opacity variations)
- Automatically hides when mining stops or drone moves

**Technical Details:**
```gdscript
var mining_laser: Line2D = null
var laser_texture: Texture2D = null
var laser_offset: float = 0.0
var laser_scroll_speed: float = 100.0
```

**Visual Effects:**
- Dynamic beam length adjusts to distance
- Pulsing width: 3.0 ± 30% based on sine wave
- Opacity variation: 0.6 - 0.8 alpha
- Z-index: -1 (renders behind units)
- Color: Green (0.3, 1.0, 0.3, 0.8)

### 2. ✅ Laser Impact Particles
**Location:** `scripts/units/MiningDrone.gd` - `spawn_laser_impact_effect()`

**Implementation:**
- Small particle burst at asteroid contact point
- Spawns every 0.5 seconds when resources extracted
- Green color matching laser beam
- 5 particles per burst, 0.3s lifetime
- Auto-cleanup after animation

**Particle Properties:**
- Direction: Upward spray (Vector2(0, -1))
- Spread: 45° cone
- Velocity: 20-40 pixels/sec
- Scale: 0.5-1.0
- Color: Green to match laser

### 3. ✅ Floating Cargo Capacity UI
**Location:** `scenes/ui/CargoIndicator.tscn` + `scripts/ui/CargoIndicator.gd`

**Visual Design:**
- Clean progress bar with text label
- Shows "[■■■■■□□□□□] 40/100" format
- Semi-transparent dark panel background
- Follows drone smoothly in world space
- Always faces camera (no rotation)
- Positioned 35 pixels below drone

**Color Coding System:**
- **0-30%**: Green (0.3, 1.0, 0.3) - Plenty of space
- **30-70%**: Yellow (1.0, 1.0, 0.3) - Getting full
- **70-90%**: Orange (1.0, 0.6, 0.0) - Nearly full
- **90-100%**: Red (1.0, 0.3, 0.3) - Full

**Panel Styling:**
- Background: rgba(0.1, 0.1, 0.15, 0.85)
- Size: 100x30 pixels
- Progress bar: 90x10 pixels
- Font: 10px, white, centered
- Shadow: 2px for readability
- Corner radius: 4px

### 4. ✅ State Management
**Location:** `scripts/units/MiningDrone.gd`

**Laser State Handling:**
```gdscript
process_gathering_state(delta):
    - Shows laser when in mining range
    - Updates laser every frame when mining
    - Hides laser when out of range
    - Hides laser when asteroid unscanned
    - Hides laser when returning/completing

start_returning():
    - Hides laser before state transition

_exit_tree():
    - Cleans up cargo indicator
```

**Cargo Indicator Management:**
- Created in `_ready()` and added to UILayer
- Updates every frame via `update_cargo_bar()`
- Follows drone position with camera conversion
- Auto-destructs when drone is destroyed

## Implementation Details

### Mining Laser Methods

**`create_mining_laser()`**
- Creates Line2D node with green texture
- Sets up visual properties
- Adds as child to drone

**`update_mining_laser(target, delta)`**
- Clears and redraws beam points
- Start: Vector2.ZERO (drone position)
- End: to_local(asteroid.global_position)
- Applies pulse animation
- Updates opacity and width

**`hide_mining_laser()`**
- Sets visibility to false
- Called on state transitions

**`spawn_laser_impact_effect(position)`**
- Creates CPUParticles2D at impact point
- Configures particle properties
- Auto-destroys after 0.5s

### Cargo Indicator Methods

**`create_cargo_indicator()`**
- Instantiates CargoIndicator scene
- Sets target_unit reference
- Adds to UILayer for proper rendering

**`update_cargo(current, maximum)`**
- Updates progress bar value
- Updates text label
- Changes color based on percentage
- Called from `update_cargo_bar()`

**Position Calculation:**
```gdscript
var viewport_center = get_viewport().get_visible_rect().size / 2
var relative_pos = (target_unit.global_position - camera.global_position) * camera.zoom
global_position = viewport_center + relative_pos + offset * camera.zoom
```

Checks distance to asteroid
    ↓
If in range (≤50 pixels):
    ↓
update_mining_laser() called
    ↓
Laser beam appears (green, pulsing)
    ↓
Every 0.5 seconds:
    ↓
Resources extracted
    ↓
Particle burst at impact point
    ↓
Cargo indicator updates color/value
```

### Mining Complete
```
Cargo full OR asteroid depleted
    ↓
start_returning() called
    ↓
hide_mining_laser()
    ↓
Laser disappears
    ↓
Cargo indicator shows full (red)
    ↓
Drone returns to command ship
```
