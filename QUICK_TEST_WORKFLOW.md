# Quick Test Workflow - Research & Building System

## Starting Resources ‚úÖ

You now start with generous resources for testing:

| Resource | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Iron Ore | 1,000 | Main building material |
| Carbon | 800 | Building component |
| Silicon | 600 | Building component |
| Copper | 500 | Building component |
| Zinc | 300 | Research costs |
| Nickel | 200 | Turret construction |
| Silver | 300 | Research costs |
| Lithium | 200 | Research costs |
| Gold | 150 | Advanced research |
| Titanium | 100 | Advanced research |

**This is enough for:**
- ‚úÖ 2+ Research Buildings (300 Iron, 250 Carbon, 200 Silicon, 150 Copper each)
- ‚úÖ Multiple research unlocks
- ‚úÖ Several turrets after research

## Test Workflow: Complete Loop

### Phase 1: Build First Research Building (2 minutes)

1. **Launch game** (GameScene.tscn)
2. **Press `B`** - Spawns Builder Drone
3. **Click Builder Drone** - BuilderDronePanel appears at bottom
4. **Click "Research Facility"** button in panel
5. **Move mouse** - Green ghost follows cursor
6. **Left Click** to place - Builder moves to site
7. **Wait 2 minutes** - Construction completes (120 seconds)

### Phase 2: Use Research System (1 minute)

8. **Click completed Research Building** - Tech Tree opens
9. **Browse categories** - Hull, Shield, Weapon, Ability, Building, Economy
10. **Click available (yellow) nodes** to research:
    - Start with: "Reinforced Hull I" (50 Iron, 30 Carbon)
    - Then: "Basic Deflector" (60 Silicon, 40 Copper, 30 Zinc)
    - Then: "Basic Turret Construction" (100 Iron, 80 Copper, 60 Zinc)
11. **Press ESC** to close tech tree

### Phase 3: Build Turret (30 seconds)

12. **Click Builder Drone** again
13. **Click "Bullet Turret"** (now available after research)
14. **Place turret** with green ghost
15. **Wait 30 seconds** - Turret constructs

### Phase 4: Build Second Research Building (Different Zone)

16. **Travel to Zone 2** (via wormhole or zone switcher)
17. **Press `B`** for new Builder in Zone 2
18. **Build Research Building** in Zone 2 (allowed, 1 per zone)
19. **Try to build 2nd in Zone 2** - Should be blocked! ‚ùå

### Phase 5: Deploy Satellite (If Researched)

20. **Research "Long-Range Sensors"** first
21. **Then research "Reconnaissance Satellite"**
22. **Deploy via code** (no UI yet):
    ```gdscript
    SatelliteManager.deploy_satellite(Vector2(1000, 1000), 1, false)
    ```
23. **Satellite reveals fog** permanently

## Quick Test Shortcuts

### Super Fast Test (1 minute)
1. Press `R` - Instant Research Building spawns
2. Click it - Tech tree opens
3. Research something
4. Press ESC

### Full Builder Test (3 minutes)
1. Press `B` - Builder spawns
2. Click Builder - Panel appears
3. Click Research Facility
4. Place with mouse
5. Wait for construction
6. Click building when done
7. Use tech tree

### Multiple Buildings Test (5 minutes)
1. Build Research Building
2. Research "Basic Turret Construction"
3. Build 3 turrets around base
4. Travel to Zone 2
5. Build another Research Building
6. Try to build 2nd in same zone (blocked!)

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Working Correctly
- [ ] Builder panel shows when Builder selected
- [ ] Green/red cost colors match affordability
- [ ] Ghost preview appears and follows mouse
- [ ] Green ghost = valid, red ghost = invalid
- [ ] Left click confirms placement
- [ ] Right click/ESC cancels placement
- [ ] Builder moves to site automatically
- [ ] Construction progress bar visible
- [ ] Building spawns when complete
- [ ] Tech tree opens when clicking Research Building
- [ ] Research consumes resources
- [ ] Unlocked buildings appear in Builder panel
- [ ] Zone limit enforced (1 Research Building per zone)

### ‚ùå Issues to Check
- [ ] Panel doesn't appear ‚Üí Check console
- [ ] Ghost doesn't follow mouse ‚Üí Check PlacementController
- [ ] Building won't place ‚Üí Check if red (invalid location)
- [ ] Resources not consumed ‚Üí Check ResourceManager
- [ ] Tech tree blank ‚Üí Check ResearchDatabase autoload

## Resource Costs Reference

### Buildings
- **Research Building**: 300 Iron, 250 Carbon, 200 Silicon, 150 Copper (120s)
- **Bullet Turret**: 100 Iron, 80 Copper, 60 Nickel (30s) [Requires research]
- **Laser Turret**: 120 Silicon, 100 Lithium, 80 Titanium (45s) [Requires research]
- **Missile Turret**: 130 Carbon, 110 Sulfur, 90 Cobalt (50s) [Requires research]

### Early Research (Available Immediately)
- **Reinforced Hull I**: 50 Iron, 30 Carbon (+15% hull)
- **Basic Deflector**: 60 Silicon, 40 Copper, 30 Zinc (+50 shields)
- **Mass Driver I**: 40 Iron, 30 Copper, 20 Nickel (+20% kinetic damage)
- **Pulse Laser I**: 40 Silicon, 30 Lithium, 20 Beryllium (+20% energy damage)
- **Basic Turret Construction**: 100 Iron, 80 Copper, 60 Zinc (unlocks turrets)

## Success Criteria

The system works if you can:
1. ‚úÖ Select Builder Drone ‚Üí Panel appears
2. ‚úÖ Click building in panel ‚Üí Placement mode starts
3. ‚úÖ Place building with mouse ‚Üí Construction begins
4. ‚úÖ Building completes ‚Üí Can click and use it
5. ‚úÖ Click Research Building ‚Üí Tech tree opens
6. ‚úÖ Research tech ‚Üí Effects apply, buildings unlock
7. ‚úÖ Build unlocked building ‚Üí Works

## Tips

- **Save resources** - Research is expensive!
- **Start with hull/shield research** - Makes your units stronger
- **Research turrets early** - Unlock defensive buildings
- **Build in different zones** - Test zone limits
- **Watch the progress bar** - Construction takes time
- **Cancel anytime** - Right-click to cancel placement

## Console Commands (Advanced)

If you need to manually test something:

```gdscript
# Give resources
ResourceManager.add_resource(0, 1000)  # Add 1000 Iron

# Unlock research
ResearchManager.unlock_research("building_turret_basic")

# Deploy satellite
SatelliteManager.deploy_satellite(Vector2(1000, 1000), 1, false)

# Spawn building instantly
var building = load("res://scenes/buildings/ResearchBuilding.tscn").instantiate()
building.global_position = Vector2(500, 500)
get_tree().current_scene.add_child(building)
```

## Expected Timeline

- **Startup**: Instant (resources loaded)
- **Select Builder**: 1 second
- **Choose Building**: 2 seconds
- **Place Building**: 3 seconds
- **Construction**: 30-120 seconds (depends on building)
- **Open Tech Tree**: 1 second
- **Research Tech**: 2 seconds
- **Build More**: Repeat

**Total for complete loop: ~3-5 minutes**

Enjoy testing! üöÄ
