- Utilizes all 100 resource types across the tree

### Performance Considerations
- Tech tree UI: Optimized node creation/destruction
- Satellite combat: Fixed update rate (0.5s intervals)
- Research effects: Cached in applied_effects dictionary
- Zone-aware: Buildings only in active zones

### Extensibility

- [x] Tech tree UI opens on Research Building selection
- [x] Research unlocking consumes resources
- [x] Research effects apply to units/buildings
- [x] Builder Drone construction works
- [x] Construction ghost shows valid/invalid placement

- [x] Combat satellites attack enemies
- [x] Research progress saves/loads correctly
- [x] Satellite data persists across save/load
- [x] No linter errors

## Known Limitations

1. **Visual Assets:** Using placeholder sprites for buildings and satellites
2. **Tech Tree Layout:** Auto-positioning may overlap nodes (manual positions recommended)
3. **Satellite Combat:** Basic implementation (direct damage, no projectiles)
4. **Building Icons:** Using generic panel graphics (custom icons needed)
5. **Research Icons:** No custom icons yet (shows colored panels)

## Conclusion

The research system is **fully functional** and ready for gameplay testing. All core features are implemented:
- 110 research nodes with full tech tree
- Building construction with Builder Drones
- Research Building with zone limits
- Satellite deployment and fog revelation
- Save/load persistence
- UI integration

The system provides a solid foundation for future expansion and can be extended with additional research nodes, buildings, and visual polish as needed.
