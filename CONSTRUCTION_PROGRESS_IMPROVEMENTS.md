# Construction Progress Visual Improvements

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. Enhanced Progress Bar (ConstructionGhost.gd)

**Before:**
- Small progress bar (100x10 pixels)
- No percentage display
- Plain styling
- Hidden at position (-50, -80)

**After:**
- **Larger progress bar** (120x16 pixels)
- **Shows percentage** (e.g., "45%")
- **Styled with borders** and colors
- Better positioning (-60, -100)
- **Custom styling:**
  - Dark background: `Color(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.8)`
  - Green fill: `Color(0.3, 0.8, 0.3, 0.9)`
  - Gray border (1px)

### 2. Construction Label Added

**New "CONSTRUCTING..." label:**
- Yellow text: `Color(1.0, 1.0, 0.3)`
- 12pt font
- Positioned above progress bar (-60, -120)
- Shows when construction starts
- Clear visual indicator that building is being built

### 3. Better Visual States

**Ghost changes appearance during construction:**
- **Placement mode:** Green pulsing (0.3 to 0.6 alpha)
- **Construction mode:** Blue tint `Color(0.8, 0.8, 1.0, 0.5)`
- **Progress opacity:** Gradually becomes more solid (0.3 → 1.0)

### 4. Debug Console Output

**Builder Drone now prints:**
- `"Arrived at site, beginning construction"`
- `"Ghost notified, progress bar should be visible"`
- `"Construction 10% complete"` (every 10%)
- `"Construction 20% complete"` (every 10%)
- ... up to 100%

This helps you see exactly what's happening during construction!

### 5. Fixed State Transition

**Improved _physics_process:**
- Now calls `process_construction()` in **both** states:
  - `MOVING_TO_SITE` - Checks distance, transitions to CONSTRUCTING
  - `CONSTRUCTING` - Actually builds

**This ensures:**
- Builder moves to site
- Automatically starts constructing when in range
- Progress updates smoothly every frame

## What You'll See Now

### During Placement
```
┌─────────────┐
│   Building  │  ← Ghost sprite (green, pulsing)
│             │
└─────────────┘
      ⭕        ← Green circle (collision radius)
```

### During Construction
```
  CONSTRUCTING...       ← Yellow label
  ████████░░░░ 67%     ← Progress bar with percentage
┌─────────────┐
│   Building  │  ← Ghost sprite (blue tint, solidifying)
│             │
└─────────────┘
      ⭕        ← Circle remains
```

### When Complete
```
Building disappears (queue_free)
  ↓
Real building spawns at same location
  ↓
Blue glow, full health bar
```

## Console Output Example

```
BuilderDrone: Starting construction of ResearchBuilding
BuilderDrone: Arrived at site, beginning construction of ResearchBuilding
BuilderDrone: Ghost notified, progress bar should be visible
ConstructionGhost: Construction started at (500, 500)
BuilderDrone: Construction 10% complete
BuilderDrone: Construction 20% complete
BuilderDrone: Construction 30% complete
...
BuilderDrone: Construction 100% complete
BuilderDrone: Construction of ResearchBuilding complete
ConstructionGhost: Construction complete, spawning building
ConstructionGhost: Spawned ResearchBuilding at (500, 500)
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Press `B`** - Spawn Builder Drone
2. **Click Builder** - Panel appears
3. **Click "Research Facility"** button
4. **Place building** - Left click on valid location (green ghost)
5. **Watch the construction:**
   - ✅ Yellow "CONSTRUCTING..." label appears
   - ✅ Progress bar shows 0%
   - ✅ Progress bar fills up (0% → 100%)
   - ✅ Percentage updates in real-time
   - ✅ Console shows progress every 10%
   - ✅ Ghost becomes more solid as it builds
   - ✅ At 100%, real building spawns

## Timing

- **Research Building:** 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- **Progress per second:** ~0.83%
- **Should see percentage increase** every few frames

## Troubleshooting

### Progress Bar Not Visible
- Check console for "Ghost notified, progress bar should be visible"
- Verify construction_ghost.start_construction() was called
- Check if builder is in range (60 units)

### Progress Not Increasing
- Check console for "Construction X% complete" messages
- If no messages, builder might not be in CONSTRUCTING state
- Verify build_state in debugger
- Check if process_construction is being called

### Builder Not Moving
- Verify navigation_agent exists on builder
- Check if BuilderDrone extends BaseUnit (which has navigation)
- Look for "Arrived at site" message in console

## Visual Feedback Summary

| State | Ghost Color | Label | Progress Bar | Circle |
|-------|------------|-------|--------------|--------|
| Placement | Green pulsing | Hidden | Hidden | Green |
| Moving | Green pulsing | Hidden | Hidden | Green |
| Constructing | Blue tint | "CONSTRUCTING..." | 0-100% | Green |
| Complete | N/A (removed) | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Success!

Construction progress is now **highly visible**:
✅ Large progress bar with percentage
✅ Yellow construction label
✅ Visual state changes
✅ Console progress updates
✅ Smooth opacity transition

You'll clearly see the building being constructed! 🏗️
