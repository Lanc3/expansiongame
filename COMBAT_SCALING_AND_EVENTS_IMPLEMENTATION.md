# Combat Scaling and Event System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive combat scaling, loot drop, and random event system for the 9-zone space exploration game. This update significantly improves replayability, combat engagement, and resource rewards.

---

## Part 1: Combat Scaling System

### Enemy Zone-Based Stat Scaling

**File:** `scripts/units/enemies/BaseEnemy.gd`

Enemies now scale their stats based on the zone they spawn in:

- **Health Scaling:** +30% per zone
  - Zone 1: 1.0x health
  - Zone 5: 2.2x health
  - Zone 9: 3.4x health

- **Damage Scaling:** +20% per zone
  - Zone 1: 1.0x damage
  - Zone 5: 1.8x damage
  - Zone 9: 2.6x damage

- **Speed Scaling:** +5% per zone (subtle increase)

### Boss Enemy System

**File:** `scripts/buildings/EnemySpawner.gd`

- **5% chance** to spawn a boss enemy instead of normal enemy
- Bosses have **3-5x stats** (random multiplier)
- Bosses are **1.5x visually larger**
- Boss types scale with zones:
  - Zones 1-3: Cruiser bosses
  - Zones 4-6: Bomber bosses
  - Zones 7-9: Enhanced Bomber bosses
- Bosses drop **5x loot** (more resources)

---

## Part 2: Loot Drop System

### LootDropSystem Autoload

**File:** `scripts/systems/LootDropSystem.gd`

Central system managing all enemy loot drops:

- **Rarity-based drops:**
  - Fighters: 1 common resource (IDs 0-19)
  - Cruisers: 1 common + 1 rare (IDs 0-39)
  - Bombers: common + rare + exotic (IDs 0-59)

- **Zone scaling:** Drop amounts scale exponentially with zone level
  - Base: 10 resources per kill
  - Multiplier: 1.5x per zone level
  - Zone 1: ~10 resources
  - Zone 5: ~50 resources
  - Zone 9: ~250 resources

- **Boss bonus:** Bosses drop 5x resources

### Visual Loot Orbs

**Files:**
- `scenes/effects/LootOrb.tscn`
- `scripts/effects/LootOrb.gd`

- Glowing orbs spawn at enemy death location
- Color-coded by rarity:
  - Gray/White: Common (0-19)
  - Blue: Rare (20-39)
  - Purple: Exotic (40-59)
  - Gold: Legendary (60-99)
- Pulse animation for visibility
- 60-second lifetime before despawn
- Fade warning in last 5 seconds

### Auto-Collection by Mining Drones

**File:** `scripts/units/MiningDrone.gd`

Mining drones automatically collect nearby loot:

- **Auto-detect:** Scans for loot within 300 units
- **Auto-collect:** Picks up loot within 30 units
- **Zone-aware:** Only collects loot in their current zone
- **Cargo-aware:** Won't collect if cargo is full
- **Smart behavior:** Prioritizes loot when idle

---

## Part 3: Random Event System

### EventManager Autoload

**File:** `scripts/systems/EventManager.gd`

Comprehensive event system with three trigger types:

#### Time-Based Events (Every 5 Minutes)
- 30% chance to trigger an event
- Picks appropriate event for current zone

#### Activity-Based Events
- **Mining threshold:** After 50 asteroids mined (40% chance)
- **Scanning threshold:** After 30 objects scanned (50% chance)
- Triggers discovery events (resource caches, derelict ships)

#### Zone Entry Events
- Triggers when entering a new zone
- Chance increases with zone difficulty (20% + 5% per zone)
- Prevents duplicate events in same zone

### Built-in Event Types

#### Combat Wave Events
1. **Pirate Ambush** (Zones 1-6)
   - 2 Fighters + 1 Cruiser
   - 15-second warning
   - 400-unit spawn radius

2. **Alien Swarm** (Zones 4-9)
   - 4 Fighters + 1 Bomber
   - 20-second warning
   - 500-unit spawn radius

3. **Boss Encounter** (Zones 7-9)
   - Boss Cruiser + 2 Fighters
   - 25-second warning
   - 600-unit spawn radius

#### Discovery Events
1. **Derelict Ship** (All zones)
   - 3x loot bonus
   - 5-second warning

2. **Resource Cache** (All zones)
   - 200 rare resources (IDs 20-39)
   - 3-second warning

#### Environmental Events
1. **Asteroid Storm** (Zones 4-9)
   - 30-second duration
   - Deals 5 damage/second to units
   - 10-second warning
   - *(Currently placeholder - no damage implementation)*

### Event Warning System

**Files:**
- `scenes/ui/EventNotification.tscn`
- `scripts/ui/EventNotification.gd`
- `scripts/autoloads/FeedbackManager.gd` (enhanced)

Visual warning notifications:

- **Top-center panel** with orange pulsing border
- **Event description** with emoji indicators
- **Countdown timer** showing time until event starts
- **Location button** to pan camera to event site
- **Audio warning** plays when event triggers
- **Auto-fade** when event starts

---

## Integration Points

### Activity Tracking

**Mining Tracking:**
- `scripts/units/MiningDrone.gd` calls `EventManager.on_asteroid_mined()` after each mining operation

**Scanning Tracking:**
- `scripts/units/ScoutDrone.gd` calls `EventManager.on_object_scanned()` after each scan completes

### Zone Tracking

**Zone Changes:**
- `EventManager` connects to `ZoneManager.zone_changed` signal
- Triggers zone entry events automatically

### Loot Integration

**Enemy Death:**
- `scripts/units/BaseUnit.gd` calls `LootDropSystem.drop_loot(self)` when enemy dies
- Only enemies (team_id != 0) drop loot

## Testing Guide

### Combat Scaling Tests

1. **Zone 1 vs Zone 9 Comparison:**
   - Spawn enemies in Zone 1, note their health
   - Travel to Zone 9, spawn same enemy type
   - Verify Zone 9 enemies have ~3.4x more health

2. **Boss Spawning:**
   - Wait for multiple enemy spawns
   - Look for larger enemies (1.5x scale)
   - Verify bosses are tougher and drop more loot

### Loot Drop Tests

1. **Kill Enemies:**
   - Destroy Fighter → expect 1 common resource orb
   - Destroy Cruiser → expect 2 orbs (common + rare)
   - Destroy Bomber → expect 3 orbs (all tiers)

2. **Auto-Collection:**
   - Kill enemy near mining drone
   - Verify drone automatically moves to collect loot
   - Check resources added to ResourceManager

3. **Zone Scaling:**
   - Kill same enemy type in different zones
   - Verify higher zones drop more resources

### Event System Tests

1. **Time-Based (5 minutes):**
   - Wait 5 minutes in-game
   - Expect 30% chance of event warning
   - Verify event spawns at marked location

2. **Activity-Based (Mining):**
   - Mine 50+ asteroids
   - Expect 40% chance of "Resource Cache" event
   - Verify bonus resources spawn

3. **Activity-Based (Scanning):**
   - Scan 30+ asteroids
   - Expect 50% chance of "Derelict Ship" event

4. **Zone Entry:**
   - Enter a new zone
   - Expect event chance based on zone (20% + 5% per zone)
   - Verify no duplicate events in same zone

5. **Warning System:**
   - Trigger any event
   - Verify warning notification appears top-center
   - Verify countdown timer works
   - Click location button → camera pans to event
   - Wait for timer → event spawns

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Loot orbs:** Auto-despawn after 60 seconds to prevent buildup
- **Event tracking:** Uses efficient counters, not constant scanning
- **Zone checks:** Loot collection only scans within same zone
- **Smart collection:** Mining drones only collect when idle/returning

---

## Future Expansion Ideas

### Easy Additions:
- Add more event types (just register in `EventManager`)
- Adjust drop rates/amounts (constants in `LootDropSystem`)
- Change boss spawn chance (export var in `EnemySpawner`)
- Add new enemy types to events

### Medium Additions:
- Equipment drops (add to loot table, requires inventory)
- Blueprint drops (integrate with existing ship builder)
- Critical hit damage numbers (modify `DamageNumber`)
- Event chains (multi-stage events)

### Complex Additions:
- Environmental hazard damage zones
- Event rewards system (credits, research points)
- Event difficulty scaling (more enemies in higher zones)
- Player-triggered events (distress beacons, scannable anomalies)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Environmental Events:** Asteroid Storm event is registered but doesn't deal damage yet (placeholder)
2. **Loot Stacking:** Resources go directly to ResourceManager (no inventory pickup UI)
3. **Event Location:** Always spawns near player units (no fixed map locations)
4. **Boss Visuals:** Only scaled 1.5x (no unique sprites yet)

---

## API for Adding New Events

```gdscript
# In EventManager.gd or any script:

func register_custom_event():
    EventManager.register_event("my_custom_event", {
        "type": "combat_wave",  # or "discovery" or "environmental"
        "warning_time": 15.0,
        "enemies": ["fighter", "cruiser"],  # for combat waves
        "spawn_radius": 400.0,
        "description": "⚡ My Custom Event!",
        "duration": 60.0  # optional, for environmental events
    })
```

✅ **Escalating Difficulty:** Zones 1-9 progressively harder
✅ **Boss Encounters:** 5% chance for 3-5x tougher enemies
✅ **Rewarding Loot:** Resources scale with zone difficulty
✅ **Dynamic Events:** Time/activity/zone-based random encounters
