## Status: Core Systems Complete ✅

The galaxy map system has been successfully implemented with dynamic zone generation, procedural naming, and on-demand discovery mechanics.

---

## Implemented Components

### 1. Enhanced ZoneManager (`scripts/autoloads/ZoneManager.gd`) ✅

**Changes**:
- ✅ Changed zone IDs from `int` to `String` (e.g., "d1_start", "d1_zone_0")
- ✅ Implemented dynamic zone generation system with `zones_by_id: Dictionary`
- ✅ Added procedural name generation (e.g., "Outer Sector Alpha", "Core Expanse Crimson")
- ✅ Implemented zone discovery tracking with `discovered` flag
- ✅ Added ring position tracking for spiral galaxy layout
- ✅ Separated lateral and depth wormhole arrays
- ✅ Added zone network seed for deterministic generation

**New Methods**:

## Architecture Overview

### Zone Structure

**Old System**: 9 linear zones (Zone 1 → Zone 2 → ... → Zone 9)

**New System**: Dynamic spiral galaxy network
- Zones organized in difficulty rings (1-9)
- Multiple zones per difficulty:
  - Difficulty 1 (outer): 8 zones max
  - Difficulty 2-3: 6 zones max each
  - Difficulty 4-6: 4 zones max each
  - Difficulty 7-8: 3 zones max each
  - Difficulty 9 (center): 2 zones max

**Zone Data Structure**:
```gdscript
{
    "zone_id": "d1_zone_0",  # String ID
    "difficulty": 1,  # 1-9
    "procedural_name": "Outer Sector Alpha",
    "discovered": true,
    "ring_position": 0.0,  # Angle on ring (0-2π)
    "size_multiplier": 1.0,
    "spawn_area_size": 4000.0,
    "boundaries": Rect2(...),
    "layer_node": Node2D,
    "lateral_wormholes": [],  # Same difficulty
    "depth_wormholes": [],  # Different difficulty
    "max_resource_tier": 0
}
```

### Wormhole Types

**Lateral Wormholes** (Cyan/Teal):
- Connect zones at same difficulty
- 2-3 per zone at evenly spaced angles
- Initially undiscovered (generate on first use)
- Enable horizontal exploration

**Depth Wormholes** (Purple/Blue):
- Connect zones at adjacent difficulties
- Forward: to higher difficulty (if < 9)
- Backward: to lower difficulty (if > 1)
- Purple for forward, blue for backward
- Enable vertical progression

### Discovery Mechanics

1. **Initial State**: Only starting zone (d1_start) exists and is discovered
2. **Lateral Discovery**: Entering undiscovered lateral wormhole generates new zone at same difficulty
3. **Depth Discovery**: Entering undiscovered depth wormhole generates/reveals zone at adjacent difficulty
4. **On-Demand Generation**: Zone layers, resources, planets, and wormholes created only when discovered
5. **Neighbor Visibility**: Undiscovered neighbors shown as "???" on galaxy map

### Galaxy Map Layout Algorithm

```python
# Position calculation for zone markers
angle = (difficulty * PI/2) + ring_position  # Spiral formation
radius = (10 - difficulty) * 60  # Outer zones farther from center
x = center_x + cos(angle) * radius
y = center_y + sin(angle) * radius
```

**Result**: Spiral galaxy with difficulty 1 at outer edge, difficulty 9 at center

## Design Decisions

### Why String Zone IDs?
- Allows unlimited procedural generation
- No hardcoded zone limit
- Supports complex zone networks
- Easier debugging (readable IDs)

### Why On-Demand Generation?
- Performance: Only create zones when needed
- Memory efficiency: No unused zones
- Exploration reward: Discovery feels meaningful
- Scalability: Can support many zones without upfront cost

### Why Procedural Names?
- Unique identity for each zone
- Immersive sci-fi feel
- Easier to remember than IDs
- Deterministic (same seed = same names)

### Why Spiral Galaxy Layout?
- Natural difficulty progression (outer → center)
- Visual clarity (easy to see difficulty at a glance)
- Aesthetically pleasing
- Supports both lateral and depth connections

---

## Performance Considerations

- Zone layers created only when discovered (saves memory)
- Inactive zones process minimally (ZoneProcessingManager)
- Galaxy map uses simple 2D rendering (no complex 3D)
- Shader is optimized (static, no per-frame updates)
- Connection lines only drawn for discovered zones

---

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains some backward compatibility:
- Old save files will need migration (or fresh start)
- Integer zone ID methods wrapped with compatibility layer (future)
- Existing zone-based systems continue to work with String IDs

---

## Credits

- Dynamic zone generation with on-demand discovery
- Spiral galaxy visualization
- Lateral + depth wormhole system
- Procedural naming
- Discovery-based exploration

Status: **Core systems complete, ALL COMPATIBILITY FIXES COMPLETE ✅**

---

## Migration Status: COMPLETE ✅

Successfully migrated **40+ files** from integer zone IDs to String zone IDs. All compilation errors resolved!

### Files Migrated (Latest Batch)
- ZoneProcessingManager.gd ✅

- EnemySpawner.gd ✅
- EnemySpawnerSystem.gd ✅
- ResourceSpawner.gd ✅
- BuilderDrone.gd ✅

### Critical Fixes
- All zone_id arithmetic operations now use zone.difficulty
- All zone loops changed from `range(1, 10)` to `ZoneManager.zones_by_id.keys()`
- On-demand resource and enemy spawning (connects to zone_discovered signal)
- SaveLoadManager saves all discovered zones (dynamic network)
