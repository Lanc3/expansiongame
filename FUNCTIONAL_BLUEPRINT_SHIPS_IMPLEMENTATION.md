# Functional Blueprint Ships - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Blueprint ships created in the ship builder are now fully functional combat units with weapon systems, shields, range indicators, and complete unit control capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Unit Selection & Control** ✅
- Blueprint ships are now fully selectable units
- Respond to all RTS commands: Move, Attack, Hold Position
- Automatic registration with EntityManager and SelectionManager
- Selection circle indicator (green when selected)
- Pathfinding and formation support via BaseUnit inheritance

### 2. **Functional Weapon System** ✅
- Weapons from blueprints are instantiated as actual WeaponComponent nodes
- Each weapon fires independently based on its stats

  - Fast projectiles (600 speed)
- **Missile Launchers:**
  - Range: 400 units
  - Fire Rate: 0.5 shots/second
  - Damage: 50 per shot
  - Homing missiles (400 speed)
- Ships with 7 weapons will fire all 7 independently

### 3. **Weapon Range Indicators** ✅
- Visual circle showing maximum weapon range
- Automatically shown when ship is selected
- Color-coded by weapon type:
  - Red: Laser weapons only
  - Yellow: Missile weapons only
  - Orange: Mixed weapon types
- Shows the maximum range across all weapons

### 4. **Shield System** ✅
- Shield generators from blueprints create functional shields
- **Shield Properties:**
  - HP: 100 per shield generator (stacks with multiple generators)
  - Recharge Rate: 5 HP/sec per generator
  - Recharge Delay: 3 seconds after taking damage
  - Radius: Scales with ship size
- Shields absorb damage before hull takes any
- Visual shield bubble with pulse animation
- Flash effect when hit
- Fades when depleted

### 5. **Dual Health Bars** ✅
- **Shield Bar (Top):** Cyan/blue color, shows shield HP
- **Health Bar (Bottom):** Green/yellow/red based on damage
- Both bars positioned above the ship
- Shield bar only visible if ship has shields
- Automatically updates during combat

### 6. **Combat Behavior** ✅
- Ships intelligently engage targets
- Move to optimal range (80% of max weapon range)
- Rotate to face targets
- Fire all enabled weapons simultaneously
- Multiple weapons create impressive barrages
- Respect individual weapon ranges (won't fire if out of range)

### 7. **Weapon Control Panel** ✅
- Automatically appears when selecting a ship with weapons
- Located in bottom-right corner
- Features:
  - Toggle individual weapons on/off
  - "Enable All" and "Disable All" buttons
  - Shows weapon type for each weapon
  - Real-time control during combat
- Only shown for player-controlled ships

## Files Created

   - Complete shield system with recharge mechanics
   - Visual effects and damage absorption
   - Configurable shield parameters

2. **scripts/components/WeaponRangeIndicator.gd**
   - Visual range circle display
   - Color-coded by weapon type
   - Toggle visibility on selection

3. **scripts/ui/ShipWeaponPanel.gd**
   - Weapon control interface
   - Individual weapon toggles
   - Bulk enable/disable controls

## Files Modified

1. **scripts/units/CustomShip.gd**
   - Added weapon instantiation from blueprint data
   - Shield component integration
   - Dual health bar creation
   - Combat behavior override
   - Selection handling for UI panels
   - Damage routing through shields

2. **scripts/buildings/Shipyard.gd**
   - Updated spawn order (add to scene tree before initialization)
   - Enhanced logging for weapon counts

3. **scenes/units/CustomShip.tscn**
   - Added collision shape
   - Added NavigationAgent2D
   - Set proper collision layers/masks

## How to Use

### Building a Ship
1. Open the Blueprint Builder (existing functionality)
2. Design your ship with hull, engines, power cores, and weapons
3. Add shield generators if desired
4. Save the blueprint

### Constructing the Ship
1. Select a Shipyard building
2. Click "Select Blueprint"
3. Choose your saved blueprint
4. Wait for construction to complete
5. Ship spawns near the shipyard

### Controlling the Ship

**Basic Commands:**
- **Left-click:** Select the ship (green circle appears)
- **Right-click ground:** Move command
- **Right-click enemy:** Attack command
- **H key:** Hold position

**Weapon Control:**
- Select ship to open Weapon Panel (bottom-right)
- Toggle individual weapons on/off
- Use "Enable All" / "Disable All" for quick control
- Disabled weapons won't fire during combat

**Range Indicators:**
- Colored circle shows max weapon range when selected
- Use this to position ships effectively in combat

### Combat Usage

**Optimal Tactics:**
1. Build ships with mixed weapons for versatility
2. Ships with shields can tank more damage
3. Ships auto-rotate to face targets and fire all weapons
4. Multiple ships in a formation create devastating firepower
5. Use range indicators to maintain optimal engagement distance

**Shield Management:**
- Shields automatically recharge after 3 seconds without damage
- Ships with multiple shield generators recharge faster
- Shield visual provides instant feedback on shield status

### Testing Ship with 7 Weapons

To test a ship with 7 weapons:

1. Create a blueprint with:
   - 30+ hull cells
   - 2+ power cores (to power everything)
   - 2+ engines (for movement)
   - 7 laser weapons or missile launchers

2. Build the ship at a shipyard

3. Select the ship and attack an enemy:
   - All 7 weapons will fire independently
   - Each maintains its own cooldown
   - Weapon panel shows all 7 weapons
   - You can toggle any of the 7 on/off

## Ship Stats Calculation

**Health:** 10 HP per hull cell
**Speed:** Based on thrust-to-weight ratio
**Shield HP:** 100 per shield generator (stackable)
**Weapon Count:** All weapons from blueprint become functional

## Technical Details

### Weapon Positioning
- Weapons are positioned at their blueprint grid location
- Position calculated relative to ship center
- Each weapon fires from its actual position on the ship

### Shield Radius
- Calculated as: `sqrt(hull_count) * cell_size * 0.6`
- Automatically scales with ship size
- Encompasses entire ship

### Combat AI
- Ships engage at 80% of max weapon range
- Smooth approach and rotation
- All weapons fire independently when in range
- Continues firing while moving into optimal range

## Known Behaviors

- Weapon panel appears automatically on selection (player ships only)
- Range indicator shows combined max range, not individual weapon ranges
- Shield visual is a simple circle with pulse animation
- All weapons enabled by default when ship spawns

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Individual range circles per weapon
- Weapon fire groups (Group 1, Group 2, etc.)
- Weapon targeting priorities
- Shield recharge sound effects
- Muzzle flash visuals at weapon positions
- Shield hit directional effects

## Compatibility

- Works with existing BaseUnit system
- Compatible with formations and group commands
- Integrates with EntityManager and SelectionManager
- Works across all zones
- Saves/loads with existing save system (weapons re-instantiate on load)
